membrane segmentation in 3D for cryo-ET

Membrain-Seg is currently under early development, so we may make breaking changes between releases.

Our best model is changing quickly, so if you would like to give MemBrain-seg a try, please reach out to us (e.g. Lorenz.Lamm@helmholtz-munich.de) and we are happy to provide you with the latest version and advice on how to best use this repository.

Preliminary [documentation](https://github.com/teamtomo/membrain-seg/blob/main/docs/index.md) is available, but far from perfect. Please let us know if you encounter any issues, and we are more than happy to help (and get feedback what does not work yet).
