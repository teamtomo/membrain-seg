# Segmentation

Welcome to the central feature of MemBrain-seg: **The segmentation of your tomograms!**

This guide provides detailed instructions to perform segmentation on your tomograms using a pre-trained model.


## MemBrain-seg Workflow
1. (Optional) [Preprocessing](./Preprocessing.md)
    - pixel size matching
    - Fourier amplitude matching
2. **Predict segmentation**
3. (Optional) [Match pixel size](./Preprocessing.md#pixel-size-matching) of output segmentation

For the optional preprocessing steps, find more information [here](./Preprocessing.md)

## Preparations

For the prediction, you will basically need two files:

1. The **tomogram** you would like to segment.  
It may make sense to use a preprocessed tomogram.
2. A **pre-trained MemBrain segmentation model**


We recommend to use denoised (ideally Cryo-CARE<sup>1</sup>) tomograms for segmentation. You can find a pre-trained segmentation model for denoised tomograms [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ZL5Ao7EnPwMHa8yq5CIkanuNyENrDeK/view?usp=sharing). 

In case you don't have denoised tomograms available, you can also use [this model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TGpQ1WyLHgXQIdZ8w4KFZo_Kkoj0vIt7/view?usp=sharing). It performs much better on non-denoised data, and maintains a good performance on denoised tomograms.

Please note that our best model changes often, as we are still in the development phase. So you can check in from time to time and see whether the model improved.
If you have problems with the model, please write an email to lorenz.lamm@helmholtz-munich.de

## Prediction
Typing
```
membrain segment
```
will display the segmentation command line interface and show available options.

For example, for the prediction, you only need to type

```shell
membrain segment --tomogram-path <path-to-your-tomo> --ckpt-path <path-to-your-model>
```

Running this will segment your tomogram, and store the resulting .mrc file into the ./predictions 
folder. If you would like to change this folder, you can simply specify another folder using
the `--out_folder` argument:

```shell
membrain segment --tomogram-path <path-to-your-tomo> --ckpt-path <path-to-your-model> --out-folder <your-preferred-folder>
```

### Note: 
MemBrain-seg automatically detects a CUDA-enabled GPU, if available, and will execute the segmentation on it. Using a GPU device is highly recommended to accelerate the segmentation process.

### Note#2: 
Running MemBrain-seg on a GPU requires at least roughly 8GB of GPU space.

### Emergency tip:
In case you don't have enough GPU space, you can also try adjusting the `--sliding-window-size` parameter. By default, it is set to 160. Smaller values will require less GPU space, but also lead to worse segmentation results!

## Post-Processing
If you have pre-processed your tomogram using pixel size matching, you may want to [rescale](./Preprocessing.md#pixel-size-matching) your 
segmentation back to the shape of the original tomogram.
