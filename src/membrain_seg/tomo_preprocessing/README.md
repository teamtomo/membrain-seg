# MemBrain-seg Preprocessing Module

## Introduction

This is a quick guide on how to use the tomo_preprocessing module for MemBrain-seg. 

In order to improve the segmentation performance of MemBrain-seg on your tomograms,
it may be beneficial to first perform some preprocessing to "normalize" the tomograms
to similar styles as the training data.

This module currently allows you to use the following preprocessing methods:
- **Pixel size matching**: Rescaling of your tomogram to a similar pixel size as the training data
- **Fourier amplitude matching**: Rescaling of Fourier components to pronounce different features in the tomograms (adapted from [DeePiCt](https://github.com/ZauggGroup/DeePiCt))

## When to use what?

We are still exploring when it makes sense to use which preprocessing technique. But here are 
already some rules of thumb:

1. Whenever your pixel sizes differs by a lot from around 10-12&Aring; / pixel, you should consider using pixel size matching. We recommend to match to a pixel size of 10&Aring;.
2. The Fourier amplitude matching only works in some cases, depending on the CTFs of input 
and target tomograms. Our current recommendation is: If you're not satisfied with MemBrain's 
segmentation performance, why not give the amplitude matching a shot?
3. Deconvolution can help with the segmentation performance if your tomogram has not already been denoised somehow (e.g. using cryo-CARE, IsoNet or Warp). Deconvolving an already denoised tomogram is not recommended, it will most likely make things worse.

More detailed guidelines are in progress!

## Usage
You can control all commands of this preprocessing module by typing `tomo_preprocessing`+ some options.  
To view all available commands, use:

`tomo_preprocessing --help`

For help on a specific command, use:

`tomo_preprocessing <command> --help`

### **Available Commands**


- **match_pixel_size**: Tomogram rescaling to specified pixel size. Example:  
`tomo_preprocessing match_pixel_size --input_tomogram <path-to-tomo> --output_path <path-to-output> --pixel_size_out 10.0 --pixel_size_in <your-px-size>`
- **match_seg_to_tomo**: Segmentation rescaling to fit to target tomogram's shape. Example:  
`tomo_preprocessing match_seg_to_tomo --seg_path <path-to-seg> --orig_tomo_path <path-to-tomo> --output_path <path-to-output>`
- **extract_spectrum**: Extracts the radially averaged amplitude spectrum from the input tomogram. Example:  
`tomo_preprocessing extract_spectrum --input_path <path-to-tomo> --output_path <path-to-output>`
- **match_spectrum**: Match amplitude of Fourier spectrum from input tomogram to target spectrum. Example:  
`tomo_preprocessing match_spectrum --input <path-to-tomo> --target <path-to-spectrum> --output <path-to-output>`
- **deconvolve**: Denoises the tomogram by deconvolving the contrast transfer function. Example:  
`tomo_preprocessing deconvolve --input <path-to-tomo> --output <path-to-output-tomo> --df <defocus-value>`

### **Pixel Size Matching**
Pixel size matching is recommended when your tomogram pixel sizes differs strongly from the training pixel size range (roughly 10-14&Aring;). You can perform it using the command

`tomo_preprocessing match_pixel_size --input_tomogram <path-to-tomo> --output_path <path-to-output> --pixel_size_out 10.0 --pixel_size_in <your-px-size>`

after adjusting the paths to your respective tomograms.
Afterwards, you can perform MemBrain's segmentation on the rescaled tomogram (i.e. the one specified in `--output_path`).  
Now, this new segmentation does not have the same shape as the original non-pixel-size-matched tomogram. To rescale the new segmentation to the original tomogram again, you can use

`tomo_preprocessing match_seg_to_tomo --seg_path <path-to-seg> --orig_tomo_path <path-to-tomo> --output_path <path-to-output>`

where the `--seg_path`is the segmentation created by MemBrain and the `--orig_tomo_path`is the original tomogram before rescaling to the new pixel size.  
The output of this function will be MemBrain's segmentation, but matched to the pixel size of the original tomogram.


### **Fourier Amplitude Matching**
Fourier amplitude matching is performed in two steps:

1. Extraction of the target Fourier spectrum:  
`tomo_preprocessing extract_spectrum --input_path <path-to-tomo> --output_path <path-to-output>`  
This extracts the radially averaged Fourier spectrum and stores it into a .tsv file.
2. Matching of the input tomogram to the extracted spectrum:  
`tomo_preprocessing match_spectrum --input <path-to-tomo> --target <path-to-spectrum> --output <path-to-output>`  
Now, the input tomograms Fourier components are re-scaled based on the equalization kernel computed from the input tomogram's radially averaged Fourier intensities, and the previously extracted .tsv file.

### **Deconvolution**

Deconvolution is a denoising method that works by "removing" the effects of the contrast transfer function (CTF) from the tomogram. This is based on an ad-hoc model of the spectral signal-to-noise-ratio (SSNR) in the data, following the implementation in the Warp package [1]. Effectively what the filter does is to boost the very low frequencies, thus enhancing the tomogram contrast, while low-pass filtering beyond the first zero-crossing of the CTF.
For the filter to work, you need to provide the CTF parameters, namely a defocus value for the tomogram, as well as the acceleration voltage, spherical aberration and amplitude contrast, if those differ from the defaults. This is typically the defocus value of the zero tilt. It does not need to be super accurate, a roughly correct value already produces decent results. While the defaults usually work well, you can play with the filter parameters, namely the deconvolution strength and the falloff, to fine-tune the results.
Example detailed command:
`tomo_preprocessing deconvolve --input <path-to-tomo> --output <path-to-output-tomo> --df 45000 --ampcon 0.07 --cs 2.7 --kv 300 --strength 1.0 --falloff 1.0`
