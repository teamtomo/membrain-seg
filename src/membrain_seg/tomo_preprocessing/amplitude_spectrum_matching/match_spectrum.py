    """
    Match the input tomogram's spectrum to the target spectrum.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_path : str
        The file path to the input tomogram to be processed.
    target_path : str
        The file path to the target spectrum.
    output_path : str
        The file path where the processed tomogram will be stored.
    cutoff : int / False
        The cutoff frequency for the spectrum matching process. All frequencies
        above will be set to 0.
        If set to False, no cutoff is performed.
    smoothen : int / False
        The smoothing factor to be applied in the spectrum matching process.
        If set to False, no smoothing is performed.
    almost_zero_cutoff : int / False
        The value below which the amplitude is treated as almost zero during the
        spectrum matching process. The cutoff will then be set to the lowest frequency
        that is below the almost-zero-cutoff.
        If set to False, no almost-zero-cutoff is performed.
    shrink_excessive_value : int / False
        A limit to shrink the excessive amplitude values during the spectrum
        matching process. Serves as a regularization.
        If set to False, excessive values will not be excluded.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Raises
    ------
    FileNotFoundError
        If the file specified in `input_path` or `target_path` does not exist.

    Notes
    -----
    This function reads the input tomogram and the target spectrum from the given paths,
    matches the amplitude spectrum of the input tomogram to the target spectrum, and
    stores the processed tomogram to the specified output path. The matching process is
    controlled by several parameters including cutoff frequency, smoothing factor, an
    almost zero cutoff, and a shrink factor for excessive values.
